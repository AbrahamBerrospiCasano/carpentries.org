The [Carpentries Community Discussions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html?) are designed for everyone in The Carpentries community interested in learning, educating and advocating for teaching foundational coding and data science skills globally. Pre and Post-workshops discussions are designed for those getting ready to teach or having recently taught to come discuss their workshop with the community. Many Carpentry workshops globally are now hosted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these discussions allow instructors to share unique online teaching experiences to instructors in-training who join the call during their check-out process.   

Even though experiencing the new found challenges associated with the current global crisis, the Community Discussion sessions have grown from strength to strength during the last six months. Not only have we automated the signup process for [Community Discussion Hosts](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html?#who-can-host) with the use of Calendly and 'some' magic from the Infrastructure Team, we hosted more than 50 pre- and post workshops discussion sessions, as well as two themed discussions in our [new online workshop series](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/05/online-workshop-themed-discussions/), with more to come.

Below are some information on the pre- and post-workshop discussion sessions held the past six months.
